# Disseminate

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jlorieau/disseminate.svg?token=4HVxi2sGcJHxUFriAmGB&branch=development)](https://travis-ci.com/jlorieau/disseminate)

Disseminate is a document processing system for textbooks, articles and other 
fiction and non-fiction writing. The Disseminate software is essentially a 
static website builder with targets for html, txt, tex, pdf and, in future 
releases, epub.

## Philosophy
1. **Extensible language**. The disseminate language is a new markup language 
   that implements basic and custom ``@tags``. New features are added by 
   implementing new tags, and unimplemented tags are rendered as ``<span>`` html 
   elements (html targets) or simple text (other targets). Additionally, users 
   can produce their own macros to automate the repitition of text and tag 
   fragments.
2. **Consistent language**. Existing markup languages, like Markdown, Wikitext 
   or REST, have simple markups for headings and text formatting (bold, 
   italics), but more complicated markup text for most other operations. The 
   Disseminate language consistently uses the @tag notion for all tags, and the 
   ``[attributes]`` notation for all attributes. The contents of a tag dictate 
   what will be displayed, while the attributes of a tag dictate how it will 
   be displayed. The formatting of documents and document projects is 
   controlled through a YAML header.
3. **Clean, simple output**. Most of the web comprises webpages with elements 
   that compete for your attention. Disseminate documents aim to have minimal 
   distractions and to follow standard rules of good typography.
4. **All-in-one dependencies**. Disseminate includes a software construction 
   framework to automatically convert file dependencies and build 
   the final site. The software construction framework tests for installed 
   build and conversion tools like ``latexmk``, ``pdflatex``, ``pdf2svg`` and 
   ``asymptote``.
5. **Viewable without javascript**. The core functionality of a website should 
   display correctly without javascript enabled.
6. **Safe**. The produced contents of Disseminate projects should be safe from 
   web vulnerabilities like XSS and should not depend on a database to produce 
   the final site.
7. **Easy publication, versioning and issue tracking**. Though Disseminate may 
   be used to generate manuscript sites independently, it is designed to 
   integrate seamlessly with the Dissemia service to publish manuscript 
   projects like Github Pages through a git server backend, continuous 
   integration and webservers.

### Usage

1. Create a project directory

```shell script
$ mkdir -p ~/Documents/Disseminate/test-project/src
$ cd ~/Documents/Disseminate/test-project
```

2. Create a root document

```shell script
$ echo "@chapter{My First Chapter}" > src/index.dm
```

3. Start the internal webserver

```shell script
$ dm preview
[2020-04-22 13:36:08 -0500] [58827] [INFO] Goin' Fast @ http://127.0.0.1:8899
[2020-04-22 13:36:08 -0500] [58827] [INFO] Starting worker [58827]
```

4. Go to ``http://localhost:8899``

## Implementation
### Core Components
1. **Document**. A document corresponds to a single disseminate source file. 
   A document may contain subdocuments, which in turn may hold additional 
   subdocuments, to form a project tree. The top-level document is known as a 
   root document, and the root document and all its subdocuments are known as 
   a project. Documents have signals for the creation, loading, deletion and 
   updating of the tree to properly process the source file.
2. **Context**. Each document own a context, which is an object derived from 
   a dict class. The basic settings for rendering a document are stored in a 
   context, and the user may change these values with entries in a documentâ€™s 
   header in the disseminate source file.
3. **Tags**. The body of the disseminate source file is placed in the body 
  entry of the context and rendered with the ``@body`` tag. Tags can be nested 
  arbitrarily up to a maximum of 30 recursions. The creation of a tag emits a 
  ``tag_created`` signal and processing of the tag contents and attributes is 
  conducted through receiver functions. The signal/receiver framework allows 
  for the easy and modular extension of new tag processing functionality.
4. **Attributes**. Attributes are parsed into a dict, which is an object 
  derived from an ordered dict. Attributes may be general, like `
  ``id=figure-1``, or they may be specific to a rendered target, like 
  ``-0.25em.tex`` for tex targets. Attributes may also be positional or 
  key-value pairs.
5. **Label Manager**. The label manager tracks the labels created by various 
   tags, like ``@chapter`` or ``@caption``, and creates links to these elements 
   in the rendered target formats using the ``@ref`` tag. The context of the 
   root document (root context) owns the label manager.
6. **Dependency Manager, Checkers and Renderers**. The old build system to 
   convert parsed documents into the rendered target projects, like html and 
   tex. The dependency manager tracks file dependencies for each disseminate 
   document, the checkers find external programs needed for conversions and 
   the renderers convert parsed tags to documents. This system is being 
   replaced by the Builder system.
7. **Templates**. Template files for producing the rendered target files.
8. **Settings**. The default settings and behavior of Disseminate when load 
   and rendering files.

### Utility Components
1. **Signals**. Disseminate uses custom signal/receiver framework inspired by 
   Blinker. This custom signal/receiver framework allows signals to also 
   register an order so that receiver functions can be executed in a specific 
   order.
2. **Paths**. Paths implements the ``SourcePath`` and ``TargetPath`` classes, 
   which are derived from ``pathlib.Path``. The SourcePath parses paths into 
   the ``project_root`` and ``subpath`` components, while the TargetPath 
   parses paths into the ``target_root``, ``target`` and ``subpath`` 
   components. Parsing of the path components is needed to recreate source 
   file tree into the rendered target formats.
3. **Server**. The server component implement a localhost webserver with 
   Sanic to display rendered files and projects.
4. **Formats**. A collection of functions to render tags and text into various 
   target formats, like html and tex. These check allowed tags in the settings.
5. **Utils**. General basic utilities used by multiple core components.

## Roadmap
### Language
1. **Builder**. Implement the Builder framework for building dependencies 
   based on md5 hashes. The builder works asyncronously to speed up builds.
2. **Citation**. Implement the ```@cite``` tag for pulling citations from 
   external sources and rendering them in the correct format.
3. **Plotting**. Implement the ``@plot`` tag to work in conjunction with the 
   ``@data`` tags to render plots.

### UI
1. **Editor**. Implement an editor interface (electron) with syntax 
   highlighting and helper functions to easily edit and submit Disseminate 
   projects.
