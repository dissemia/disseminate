  <p>The purpose of the <span class="abrv">INEPT</span> sequence<span class="cite">Morris1979</span> is to
transfer the large magnetization from high-&gamma; nuclei, like <sup>1</sup>H or
<sup>19</sup>F, to low-&gamma; nuclei (labeled &#8216;X&#8217;), like <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N. This transfer
significantly improves the signal intensity of &#8216;X&#8217; nuclei when
measuring their chemical shifts. For example, the magnetic moment and
magnetization of <sup>1</sup>H nuclei is roughly 4 times greater than <sup>13</sup>C and 10
times greater than <sup>15</sup>N. Additionally, the <sup>1</sup>H <span class="t1"/> is typically much
shorter than the <span class="t1"/> for <sup>13</sup>C or <sup>15</sup>N, which allows a shorter recycle
delay and the collection of a greater number of spectra.</p>

  </p>
  <p>The <span class="abrv">INEPT</span> sequence (<span class="ref"><a href="/html/inept.html#fig:inept-inept1"><strong>Fig. 1.1</strong></a></span>) transfers
magnetization from <sup>1</sup>H nuclei bonded the &#8216;X&#8217; nuclei. The two
nuclei must be bonded, or at least connected through intermediary
bonds with other atoms, because the nuclei must share a J-coupling.</p>
  <p>The <span class="abrv">INEPT</span> sequence comprises a set of <span class="p90"/> pulses (thin bars),
<span class="p180"/> pulses (thick bars) and delays (&Delta;).</p>
  <h3 id="subsec:inept-dm-methine-amide-and-the-ax-spin-systems">
    <span class="subsection"><span class="number">1.1.1.</span> Methine, Amide and the AX Spin Systems</span>
  </h3>
  <p>The first <span class="p90x1h"/> pulse creates <img class="eq" src="/html/media/inept_143da60629.svg"/> <sup>1</sup>H magnetization.
<span class="sidenote">A <span class="p90x"/> pulse rotates the magnetization by <span class="p90"/> with a phase
of &#8216;x&#8217;.</span>  Thereafter, the <sup>1</sup>H <span class="p180"/> pulse in the middle of the two
&Delta; delays acts as a Hahn-echo to refocus the <sup>1</sup>H chemical
shifts. Without the accompanying <span class="p180"/> pulse on the &#8216;X&#8217; channel, the
J-coupling between the <sup>1</sup>H and X nucleus would be refocused as
well&#8212;and nothing would be accomplished. The <span class="p180"/> pulse on the &#8216;X&#8217;
channel acts to <i>cancel</i> the refocusing effect of the <sup>1</sup>H <span class="p180"/>
pulse for the J-coupling.</p>
  <p>During the first delta period, the <img class="eq" src="/html/media/inept_54c1d66023.svg"/> magnetization evolves
under the <sup>1</sup>H chemical shift (<span class="csh"/>) and the <sup>1</sup>H-X
J-coupling. Since the chemical shift and J-coupling Hamiltonians
commute, the rotations of each can be conducted sequentially.</p>
  <p>In the first step, the operators are propagated for the <span class="p90x1h"/> pulse
and the first '&Delta;' period. We&#8217;ll use a <sup>15</sup>N nucleus as an example
of an &#8216;X&#8217; nucleus.</p>
