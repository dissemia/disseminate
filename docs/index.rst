Write documents once and publish for the web, in pdf and in other formats.

Disseminate is a document processing system to generate documents in
multiple formats (html, pdf, etc.) suitable for academic and non-academic
publishing. Disseminate can be used to publish textbooks, journal articles,
articles, blogs and websites. It uses a simplified markup system as well as
extensive and extensible tag functions.
