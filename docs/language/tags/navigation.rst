Navigation tags are used to create html links to other documents, like the
previous or next document.

``@prev``
    A link to the previous document

    .. index::
        single: tags; @prev

    :attributes:

        ``kind``

           The kind of label to link to create the link to. By default,
           the link is created to the first heading label, like ``@chapter``.

          @prev


``@next``

    :attributes:
